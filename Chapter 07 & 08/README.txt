Note: Texas_Hold'em depends on SimpleTimingLib!

The Texas Hold'em Poker addon is licensed under the open source license
"Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0".
This means that you are free to modify the addon and distribute your modified version
as long as you keep the license and a notice where the original addon is from. The full
text of the license can be found in the file license.txt in the folder Texas_Hold'em.
This license basically means the following:

You are free:
    * to Share — to copy, distribute and transmit the work
    * to Remix — to adapt the work

Under the following conditions:
    * Attribution — You must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they endorse you or your use of the work).
    * Share Alike — If you alter, transform, or build upon this work, you may distribute the resulting work only under the same, similar or a compatible license.


The advantage of using such a license is that it keeps the addon free; you will be able
to modify and redistribute all versions created by different people all around the world.

There are a lot of exciting features waiting to be implemented in the poker mod, for
example a simple task would be replacing SimpleTimingLib with the embedded library
that is discussed in chapter 10. Another feature you can add to the poker addon would be an
observer mode that is currently missing or an admin/moderator mode to kick or ban players.
It's up to you to improve the addon, I just implemented the game logic with a simple user
interface.

this means you'll also keep an attributen to him if you distribute a modified version
with his images.


P.S.: Yes, I know that the CC license was not meant to be used for software. But I really 
like the license because it is available in so many different "flavors". Btw: DBM is also
published under a Creative Commons license :)
