All Lua files from this chapter require World of Warcraft to be executed, 
however they are not bundled in an addon here. The reason for this is that 
you should, as mentioned in Chapter 12, create your own simple addon containing 
random stuff like functions you use in macros or small debugging functions.
You can then copy & paste the files (or just the code from the files) from this 
folder into your "random stuff"-addon to load them.
