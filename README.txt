Most examples are supplied as normal World of Warcraft addons. Just copy & paste 
the addon folders from the chapter folder into your Interface\AddOns folder and 
restart World of Warcraft to install the example addons.
A few examples are not wrapped in addons as they don't depend on the game. These 
plain Lua files can just be opened in SciTE or your favorite IDE/Editor to execute 
them.
The chapter subfolders might contain additional readme files with additional
information, you should read them too.

The examples of chapter 7 and 8 are combined in a single addon as it would be
pointless to split up the Poker addon (which is covered in these two chapters)
into two parts.
